PRFCreator
==========

### What is a pre-rooted firmware
A pre-rooted firmware is a firmware, which already includes root. This is for example important if you want to update the firmware to a version, where there is no public root exploit. To flash a pre-rooted firmware, you need a recovery menu. An unlocked bootloader is **not** required.
